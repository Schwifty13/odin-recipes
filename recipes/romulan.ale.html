                <li>250 denkirs of khellid nectar or kheh</li>
                <li>5000ml water</li>
                <li>1000g grounded hops</li>
                <li>1000ml Earth whiskey</li>
                <li>2Kg Ice cubes (optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Utensils</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 beer glass </li>
            <li>1 small measuring cup</li>
            <li>1 mixing cup</li>
            <li>1 large cooking pot (at least 15L in size)</li>
            <li>blender</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <em>Note: There is no need to sterilize the equipment, as the drink is so strong no bacterium or germs can survive in it.</em>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Add all igredients to blender and blend everything together until you have a nice uniform liquid</li>
            <li>Add all the ingredients to the pan.</li>
            <li>Bring the temperature up to boiling point. Let your brew boil for at least 900 siurens</li>
            <li>Check if the brew is nice and blue (the color starts to set in at around 800 siurens of boiling)</li>
            <li>For a light blue ale (less strong) remove from boiling at 900 siurens.</li>
            <li>For a dark blue ale (stronger), let the brew boil for longer than 1000 siurens.</liu><br>
                <em>Although there is no theoretical limit to how strong you can make the ale, by just letting it brew for longer and longer,<br>
                we do not recommend boiling times over 2500 siurens, as the drinks becomes too strong for even Klingon stomachs.</em>
            <li>Let the brew settle down and cool. Once its cool add the ice.</li>
            <li>Transfer the liquid to an air tight bottle, and let it ferment inside the bottle for another 500 siurens.</li>
            <li>At this point your ale is ready to serve. Make sure you use a tall transparent glass, to show of the blue colour of your homebrew!</li>
