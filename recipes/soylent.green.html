            <hr>
            <ol>
                <li>Find yourself a good, high quality human, and get 2Kg of his meat.<br>
                    (if you get more, save the rest for later, you can always make a fine stew with it).</li>
                <li>If you have a meat grinder, mince the meat; If not, dice in very small cubes.</li>
                <li>Add the meat and the remaining ingredients to the blender.</li>
                <li>Season with the pepper to your taste.</li>
                <li>Blend everything until you get a beautiful, uniform, green pulp (if its not green enough, add more seaweed).</li>
                <li>With a soup spoon, take a piece of the mixture and place it on your meat press.</li>
                <li>Press the mixture until its  nice and compact.<br>
                    You can then shape how you wish, but for historical consistency we suggest a square shape.
                </li>
                <li>Let the squares set for a couple of minutes in a piece of kitchen paper, to absorb excess water.</li>
                <li>In a medium heated frying pan, put your squares just long enough just so they get a beautiful vibrant green colour. </li>
                <li>Serve while its hot!</li>
            </ol>
