        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <strong>Serving size:</strong> 6 persons
            <ul>
                <li>1 teacup water</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>ground black pepper</li>
                <li>500g fresh seaweeds (or any other green plant thing)</li>
                <li>2Kg quality people meat</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Utensils</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>blender</li>
            <li>meat press</li>
            <li><em>meat grinder (optional)</em></li>
            <li>frying pan</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Find yourself a good, high quality human, and get 2Kg of his meat.<br>
                (if you get more, save the rest for later, you can always make a fine stew with it).</li>
            <li>If you have a meat grinder, mince the meat; If not, dice in very small cubes.</li>
            <li>Add the meat and the remaining ingredients to the blender.</li>
            <li>Season with the pepper to your taste.</li>
            <li>Blend everything until you get a beautiful, uniform, green pulp (if its not green enough, add more seaweed).</li>
            <li>With a soup spoon, take a piece of the mixture and place it on your meat press.</li>
            <li>Press the mixture until its  nice and compact.<br>
                You can then shape how you wish, but for historical consistency we suggest a square shape.
            </li>
            <li>Let the squares set for a couple of minutes in a piece of kitchen paper, to absorb excess water.</li>
            <li>In a medium heated frying pan, put your squares just long enough just so they get a beautiful vibrant green colour. </li>
            <li>Serve while its hot!</li>
        </ol>
